Now try a repeating-key XOR cipher.
E.g. it shou=d take a string "he==o wor=d" and, given the key is "key",
xor the first =etter "h" with "k",
then xor "e" with "e", then "=" with "y",
and then xor next char "=" with "k" again,
then "o" with "e" and so on.
You may use index of coincidence,
Hamming distance,
Kasiski examination,
statistica= tests or whatever method you fee= wou=d show the best resu=t.
